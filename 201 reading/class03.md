## Review from Reading 02 - Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions

Arrays store multiply data in a single varible. using the `typeof` javascript can tell you what type of data a varible is string number or boolean

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on

switch statements : switch the varible's data

Loops let you repeat an actions as many times as you want while chance a certain varible that you want every reapet or **Loop**. You can tell it for x = 1  run a loop 10 times and and increase x by 1 every loop. That code will look like this
`for (let x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
    return x ; 
}`
## For Loops

As you ca see in the code we use a **For statement**.
for loops run until the staement written in them is false
`for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])`
that is a structure of a for loop.
