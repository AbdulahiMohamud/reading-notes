# Introduction

## How the web works

You first have to an isp or an internet service provider after that you search the name of the website or otherwise known as domain name. Your computer will then access the dns `(domain name system)` which is like a phone book for domain names. The dns will send the ip address of  the domain name back to the computer. The computer will then send the ip to a web server that will show the user the website they were looking for. A web server is a computer that is always connected to the web

## Chapter 1 structure

Html is used to structure the website. In html there are things known as elements. Elements usually have an opening`<p>` and closing tab `</p>`. Tags act like containers and will tell you what information are in them.
Another feature of elements are the attributes that can be placed in the opening tags.Attributes have 2 parts in them: name and value. 

- Name- informs us what extra value is being added to the element , should be in lowercase
- Value- is the setting of the name and should be in double quotes.
`<p lang = “en-us”>American English</p>` . The lang is the name and the en-us is the value.

## Chapter 8 extra markup

If ypu wanted to comment in your html code, vox your comment within `<!-- and -->` this with show up as green in the text editior and wont affect your code or website.
the `<div>` or `<span>` elements crate a block a code making it easier to edit them with css.Escape charaters help to use spacial charters as text and not code for example the`<`is an opening tag so the html will read it as such breacking your code. so instead you can use an escape character for that which is `&lt;` or`&#60;`

## chapter 17 html5 layout

html5 help reduse the use of `<div>` and instead made new elements to help the programmer understand whats happing inside the element. older version of broswers cannot access html5 elements unless additional javascript is added.this can be found on google for free. Older broswers also do not know the html5 block elements and need to betold them.

## chapter 18 process and design

Before you start coding you first have to have a clear idea and understanding of what youre going to make. You have to answer questains like whos your targert audience, why did they come to your website and what will they get from being there. Once you answered those qustains then you can start a wireframe. A wireframe is a basic blueprint of the project. The wireframe shows the basic details of the interface to help get an understanding of what the developer is invisioning. the first wire fram is mostly done by hand this help making rough sketches until you have a genaral idea. Once you and youre group are happy with the frame , then code away.

## JS Chapter 1: “The ABC of Programming”

***How do you create a script?***

- To write a script you have to break down the task into a series that answer yes or no questains and what needs to be done if the answer is yes or no through out the series

Computers first digest the html code into the model of the page using the browsers guideline. this is also how programmers are able to add events into there websites.

To merge your javascript code with your Html the `<script>` tag is needed. this tell the computer to load in the file and check what to do.
