# OOP

## Classes 

- Classes work like they did in React. You have a class and then you can extend the class with subclasses.
- You can now access all the information with the orginal class but keep unique properties in the subclass.

```Java
//class declarations
class SecondClass (String movie1, String meal1, int space1) {
  movie = movie1;
  meal = meal1;
  space = space 1
    
}

class SecondClass extends FirstClass implements YourAmenities {
    
}

//You can use modifiers
//Capitalize Class names
// Extend parent class
//Sperate multiple interfaces with comma on the 
```
- use parameters to pass information to class constructors and methods

## Object

- Objects has State and Behavior e.g of a real world object A dog has a state of name or color or breed and a behavior of barking ,fetching and wagging tail.
- An object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages) and exposes its behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages).
- Java Program creates many objects which are invoke using methods
###Bundling code into individual software objects provides a number of benefits, including:
1. Modularity: The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects. Once created, an object can be easily passed around inside the system.
2. Information-hiding: By interacting only with an object's methods, the details of its internal implementation remain hidden from the outside world.
3. Code re-use: If an object already exists (perhaps written by another software developer), you can use that object in your program. This allows specialists to implement/test/debug complex, task-specific objects, which you can then trust to run in your own code.
4. Pluggability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement. This is analogous to fixing mechanical problems in the real world. If a bolt breaks, you replace it, not the entire machine.


Objects have 3 parts:
- Declarations
- Instantiation : `new` keyword important
- Initialization : `new` Keyword important


- Use `return` when you need to return a value from method
- Use `this` within the instance of constructor class

## Decimals

### Base10
- Base 10 uses the 10 numerical characters 0-9

### Binary
- Base 2 meaning only using characters 0-1

### Hexadecimal
- Use all Base 10 characters 0-9 but also use the first 6 characters of Alphabet A-F
