## Comparison operators

- `Not equal (!=)`
- `Strict equal (===)`
- `Strict not equal (!==)`
- `Greater than (>)`
- `Greater than or equal (>=)`
- `Less than (<)`
- `Less than or equal (<=)`

## Assignment operators
The value of the left varible is dependent on the left on
`x += f()` this means that `x = x + f()`.

## Loops and iteration

Loops let you repeat an actions as many times as you want while chance a certain varible that you want every reapet or **Loop**. You can tell it for x = 1  run a loop 10 times and and increase x by 1 every loop. That code will look like this
`for (let x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
    return x ; 
}`
## For Loops

As you ca see in the code we use a **For statement**.
for loops run until the staement written in them is false
`for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])`
that is a structure of a for loop.

## While Loops

a while loops runs as long as it believes the condition given to it are true. `while (condition)
  statement`
  if the condition is deemed false the while loop passes off control to the the next stament below the loop.
  ***MAKE SURE THE STATEMENT BECOMES FALSE EVENTUALLY OR YOU WILL BE STUCK IN AN ENDLESS LOOP
