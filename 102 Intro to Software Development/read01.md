# **WHAT I LEARNED IN CLASS**

## **Growth Mindset**
We first talked about how to get into the right mindset for the course. the mindset was to understand that that when challenges appeer 
not to avoid them but to take them head on without quiting. hardwork and persistance is the key to most problem sand to take care of both your mental
and physical health.

## **GitHub Pages**
github pages is a site that takes your code like html, css or java script from your repository and publishes it into a simple website with multiple
diffrent types ofthemes to choose from. This webpage runs on github.io or your own custom domain. this helps so you can see the simple version of your
code much faster.

## **Markdown**
Markdown is a language just like html and javascript but iys used to edit text. Some examples of mark down are putting \** in the beginig and end of a 
sentance to make it bold. Another one is \- or \* in the begining to create an unordered list.
