##Growth Mindset
In my understanding growth mindset mean that every thing is learnable and _hardwork and persistance trumps everything_. Never ~giveup~.

3 things i need to remember is that 
-[x]*Embrace the hardships and take them head on*
-[x]*Noone is inherently bad at something every new starts off hard or confusing*
-[x]*Take a step back or sleep on a problem before deeming it an impossible* ![sleeping image](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fsimg.nicepng.com%2Fpng%2Fsmall%2F313-3139181_sleeping-in-bed-filled-icon-sleep-in-bed.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nicepng.com%2Fourpic%2Fu2w7o0r5e6u2e6t4_sleeping-in-bed-filled-icon-sleep-in-bed%2F&tbnid=7G7B__WFE0DKVM&vet=12ahUKEwik44_IiJL2AhUhFzQIHRgFB6EQMygLegUIARDVAQ..i&docid=_ZKonlyiFoUeKM&w=300&h=300&q=stickman%20sleeping&hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwik44_IiJL2AhUhFzQIHRgFB6EQMygLegUIARDVAQ)
