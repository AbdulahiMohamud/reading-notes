#My Understanding :EMOJICODE:monocle_face:
##Growth Mindset
hello, My name is Abdulahi and this is my understanding about the growth mindset.To me the growth mindset means that every thing is learnable and _hardwork and persistance trumps everything_. Never ~giveup~.

3 things i need to remember is that 
-[x] *Embrace the hardships and take them head on*
-[x] *Noone is inherently bad at something every new starts off hard or confusing*
-[x] *Take a step back or sleep on a problem before deeming it an impossible*
