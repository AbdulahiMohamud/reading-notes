#My Understanding :monocle_face:
##Growth Mindset
hello, My name is Abdulahi and this is my understanding about the growth mindset.To me the growth mindset means that every thing is learnable and _hardwork and persistance trumps everything_. Never ~giveup~.

3 things i need to remember is that 
-[x]*Embrace the hardships and take them head on*
-[x]*Noone is inherently bad at something every new starts off hard or confusing*
-[x]*Take a step back or sleep on a problem before deeming it an impossible* ![sleeping image](https://www.nicepng.com/ourpic/u2w7o0r5e6u2e6t4_sleeping-in-bed-filled-icon-sleep-in-bed/)
