- A wireframe is a basic blueprint of the project. The wireframe shows the basic details of the interface to help get an understanding of what the developer is invisioning. the first wire fram is mostly done by hand this help making rough sketches until you have a genaral idea. Then you move onto digital wireframe, this way you can share it with more people who can then further add more details until you are satisfied with the end results, then begins the coding.
