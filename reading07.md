# Javascript 2

**Control flow** - this is the order the computer reads its code. Even though most code is read from up to down you stll have to look at some programs stucture because they can make the code reread them like loops and functions.

**Functions** - A function in js is a accumilation of code made to do a unique task. To run the function you need to call it which means to put `()`
. A function is writen and returned in the same block of code.
`function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;
 } `            

the return statment is asking for the output of the varible after going throug the function
